# NLP-Text-Generator
NLP with the help of RNN and Embbeded Layer and GRU to produce some text after Tarining the model on some book

## About
Here, a model is been trained on some text mostly some book**The book dataset has been taken from the [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)**

### Note
~~***To increase the model accuracy more, the work is in progress as I am learning morre about it. Future update will increase its efficency***~~

* **Implemented Tokenizer for encoding the text rather than single digit encoding which was implemented earlier**

* **Due to this model now can have better sentence relation in its emmbed form or in the vector form**

## Result

***After changing the encoding format, the same model is able to generate more readable text on the same parsed input. More efficient parameters will be included***
